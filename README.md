# MemoGarden

A gamified web application for flashcard creation and revision themed around tending to an ethereal mental garden.

## Context

The project is developed for a course at International University of Applied Sciences. The rationale for choosing this
project topic is as follows: spaced repetition with flashcards is a strong memorization tool, but many conventional
flashcard applications tend to be highly functional and lack motivational aspects, causing some learners to perform
suboptimally; therefore, a relaxing and gamified approach has the potential to enhance the learning experience for many
users.
