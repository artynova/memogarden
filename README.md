# MemoGarden

A gamified web application for flashcard creation and revision themed around tending to an ethereal mental garden.

## Context

The project is developed for a course at the [International University of Applied Sciences](https://www.iu.org/). The
rationale for choosing this
project topic is as follows: spaced repetition with flashcards is a strong memorization tool, but many conventional
flashcard applications tend to be highly functional and lack motivational aspects, causing some learners to perform
suboptimally; therefore, a relaxing and gamified approach has the potential to enhance the learning experience for many
users.

-   Card revision with an optional "answer attempt" field for accountability
-   Markdown formatting support for card content, as well as a rich editor with Markdown syntax highlighting and a preview
